    Charlie McAvoy will miss at least four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, the Boston Bruins said Tuesday. The rookie defenseman was injured during the first period of the Bruins' 2-1 overtime win against the Montreal Canadiens
    on Saturday. McAvoy left 37 seconds into the game after a hit by Montreal forward Brendan Gallagher. He hobbled off the ice and didn't return. The Bruins said McAvoy's injury will be re-evaluated in four weeks. McAvoy, 20, has 32 points (seven goals,
    25 assists) in 59 games and averages 22:06 of ice time per game, second on the Bruins to defenseman Zdeno Chara (23:11).
