      Charlie McAvoy will miss at least four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, the Boston Bruins said Tuesday. The rookie defenseman was injured during the first period of the Bruins' 2-1 overtime win against the Montreal Canadiens
      on Saturday. McAvoy left 37 seconds into the game after a hit by Montreal forward Brendan Gallagher. He hobbled off the ice and didn't return. The Bruins said McAvoy's injury will be re-evaluated in four weeks. McAvoy, 20, has 32 points (seven goals,
      25 assists) in 59 games and averages 22:06 of ice time per game, second on the Bruins to defenseman Zdeno Chara (23:11).

      Jasper Cillessen was the hero as Barcelona beat Espanyol 4-2 on penalties on March, 7, 2018 to lift the Catalan Super Cup, exacting revenge for last season's defeat against the same opponent. Cillessen was famously taken off by Netherlands coach Louis
      van Gaal before a penalty shootout at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil but he stayed on against Espanyol to save from Jose Manuel Jurado and seal the win.
